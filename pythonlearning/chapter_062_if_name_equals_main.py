# if __name__ == '__main__'

# why?
# 1. Module can be run as a standalone program
# 2. Module can be imported and used by other modules

# Python interpreter sets "sepcial variables", on of which is __name__
# Python will assign the __name__ variable a value of "__main__" if it's the initial module being run

# for this chapter, see modules "module_one" and "module_two" together as first exameple. then "module_three" and "module_four" togeteher as second example.
